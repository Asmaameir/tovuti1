    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink with distinct aroma and flavour,prepared from roasted coffee beans,the seeds found inside
    "beries" of the cofee plant. Cofee plsnts are cultivated in over 70 countries,primarily in equitorial Latin America,
    Southeast Asia,India and Africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica and the less
    sophiscated but but stronger and more hardy robusta.The latter is resistent to the cofee leaf rust, Hemileia vastatrix,
but has a more bitter taste .Once ripe ,Cofee beans are picked ,processed and dried .Green(unroasted) coffee beans
are one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world.Once traded ,the beans are roasted to varying degrees
,depending on the desired flavour,before being ground and brewed to create cofee. Cofee is slightly acidic and can have a
stimulating effect on humans and because of its caffeine content.it is one of the most popular drinks in the world.it can be prepared 
and presented in variety ways .The effect of cofee on human health has been a subject of many studies; However ,results hav varied in terms of 
coffee's relative banefit.The majority of recent research suggests that moderate coffe consuption is benign or mildly beneficial in health
adults.However the diterpenes in coffee may increase the risk of heart disease</p>
